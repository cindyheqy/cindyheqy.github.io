# My Diary

Apr 13: 
Talked with Yunhao. He said I can apply for the summer internship in this fall and recommend to me some data science bootcamp.
Talked with Yu. He suggested me to apply for a CS master degree. But I think that's too expensive and time-consuming. 
Ruixuan suggested me to take a gap year but I'm worried about wasting the time. 
Connected with Dajing. She suggusted me to do some unpaid projects. But I think I need to first acquire some basic skills for coding. And I also need to begin doing Leetcode. Also very important to revise my resume and build my network!!!

Apr 14: 
Though very tired, I came to the Python class. Completed HW2 at noon and had Mc Donald!!! (strawberry shake and $1 large fries..). I asked TAs and the professor for help when I had difficulty understand the question. Also learned what 'argument' is and how to create a 'class'. 
Learned 'variables' and 'objects' in Javascript. 

Apr 15: 
Learned 'operations and methods' in Javascript in the morning. 
Revised my resume and built my LinkedIn profile with Lina~ (Also helped her and Nilaoshi do some python debug) 
Too anxious to fall asleep at night...

Apr 16: 
Purchased a new Macbook Pro on Apple.com. It will be delivered after May 24th. Cannot wait! (\ANGRY)	&#128555;
Failed to complete the coding challenge for 'Hack Reacter' bootcamp, which is actually my goal for last day. But it's OK since it's on weekend. 

Apr 17: 
Failed to fall asleep again last night. 
Saw someone posted an article saying that less than 10% of the Chinese MPP student in Harris found a job in the US. I was kinda disappointed and discouraged. I think I do not have a CS master degree, and I learn all the things not systematically. I also lack some project experience. Even not clear about my career goal. Why am I outstanding among all talented candidates? Passion? Does my passion really matters so much that can make me outstanding? I also need work permit, which makes it even more difficult to find a SDE job and stay in the US. But what can I do? The only thing that I can do is to continue learning, continue searching for projects, continue being anxious. The only way to get through is to not thinking too much and just do it. I CAN DO IT. 

生活磨平了我的棱角
可我还是想做个小孩

Made an appointment for the tech interview of Hack Reactor bootcamp. And completed non-tech assessment for App Academy. 
Considering transfer to a CS master program. Made appointment to talk with MPCS admission specialst on Tuesday and talk with academic advisor on Thursday. 
Also considering other CS master program like NEU. But the title is not so good (tbh). 

Apr 18: 
Had a phone call with Bri and scheduled the A/A non-tech interview on Wednesday afternoon. And will prep with Bri on that same day in the morning. 
Received reply for visa problem. Gina said that during the gap quarte / year, I would be illegal to say in the US. I realized the problem that those internship for large company requires me to go back to school after the internship. Or I have to apply for the full-time job. So I have to talk to the Academic Advisor to see if it is ok to change my graduate year to the next year. Also I need to check if I could have time to do CPT after the gap year. Also I have to browse some JD for last year internship.

Sitting in the dt gleacher classrom. <br> 
Taking accounting as background music. <br> 
Looking around:   <br> 
All elites with booth name tag. <br> 
Browsing 1acre3points. <br> 
Thinking: Do I really love these things? <br> 
Suddenly feel like I am a loser. <br> 
Too many thoughts, too few actions. <br> 
High intellegence, low social skills. <br> 
Always hesitate, afraid to take risk. <br> 

The bad thing: I know this is not I want now. <br> 
The good thing is: At least I know what I want and a way to pursue. <br>

Today I did the tech interview for Hack Reactor bootcamp. First time do live coding and talk aloud my way of thinking. I am quite sure that I can get admitted since I'm prepared and did several coding problems successfully. Though my mind went blank at first and I requested for help, I did the rest of the problems successfully. So the fact tells us I should request help once get stuck. Also I have to train myself to say aloud my thinking while coding. This is also something important in the future interview. <br>
I posted my way of changing my career goal to SDE on 1point3acres. Suprisingly my undergraduate classmates contacted me and recommend his bro to me. He shared some information about cs program to me. Also a lot of friends contacted me through linkedIn. Hope to get more connection with them! 
I believe I can do this. I think all the effort I have done has already persuaded myself that I am really very decided to persist on this way. And I belive that 'Nothing is impossible to a willing heart.' Also, although seeing that technical stock decreases a lot, this is still the best and almost the only way to saty in the US. 

<b>Apr 21 Thu</b><br />
CANNOT fall asleep again! Talked with my academic advisor at noon face to face in his office, and he said that I can withdraw from the MPP program before next fall and return back any time later (but have to apply again). He also recommended me to talk with OIA to confirm the visa problem. He also recommended me a MSCAPP staff that I can contact with. <br>
Asked Yu and he referred Yunchen to me, who is a MPCS student with an undergraduate major in Chinese Literature. She emphasized the importance of a SDE internshiip. 
Received a lot of connections on LinkedIn. Really appreciate everyone's kindness to me. They allocate their limited time to help me, which moves me and encourages me a lot. Also got few people to refer to when meeting difficulties. <br>

<u><b>THANKS EVERYONE WHO OFFERED HELP TO ME!</b></u>

<b>Apr 22 Fri</b><br />
I think I spend too much time on chatting with others these days. But this might be a necessary process. I did get a lot of information and help. Just a little bit disappointed when others did not reply to me. <br>
Received offer from Hack Reactor Bootcamp. <br>
Began application process for MPCS master program. Deciding who to ask for recommendation letter. 

<b>Apr 23 Sat</b><br />
Started learning 'The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022' on Udemy. Laying on the bed for the most of the day. Searched how to write personal statement when applying to a new major. Emailed a youtuber who learned international Relation in her first master degree. Hope to connect with her and ask her about her motivation to transfer to cs master degree. 

<b>Apr 24 Sun</b><br />
I started to know more about the software engineer position itself. Watched lots of videos on Youtube made by software engineers (<u>HackBear</u>). Also trying to find more people in this field to connect with. Hope to know more in this field. <br />

<b>Apr 25 Mon</b><br />
I called Ely DING. He learned my background and suggested me to: 1. take the placement exam and get a good grade. 2. connect with people in cs department face to face. 3. do some projects with hard cs tools. He also gave me a lot of advice on application details. 
Also asked Adagio about her writing of personal statement. She suggested me to think more about the vision of computer science. 

<b>Apr 26 Tue</b><br />
Did two big things today. 
1. Went to the office hour of Professor Jeff Levy. Talked with him my plan of becoming a software engineer. He suggested me to pursue a CS master degree (compared to attending a bootcamp or learning by myself). Because a CS degree shows as a signal that you are very dedicated to this field, both time and money. He also suggested me to learn C and do some projects using html.  <br>
2. Went to the CS department. I REALLY LOVE BEING THERE! They all look rigorous and energetic. I love their labs. I love those tech-looking people. Wish I could be an undergraduate student majoring in computer science. I saw their notes on the whiteboard. They are really loving those codes and doing things they love. They are so energetic and full of thoughts. It gives me a feeling that those talents are discussing something that can change the world (sounds crazy). And I also really love the building, the inner design of the JCL. Mordern and fashion. Lots of discussion and learning space outside the conference room and labs. It's easy to get lost in the building though hahahah! Also met Emma! She's so kind and suggested me to email the questions@cs.uchicago.edu. Thanks her!

Had a lot of thoughts today. When I'm in the investment class, I suddenly found myself loving doing regression and those complicated calculating stuff. I kinda think myself as weird, because in previous times I never believe anyone really loves those math things. If there is someone loving theses things, then they must be weird. But finally when I found myself interested in it, I suddenly can understand this kind of feeling and think everyone is unique and has his or her own love. This also strengthens my belief to do CS. I actually have a deeper thought after today's class. 
i see computer as an extension of my brain. I can use computer to do some stuff that my brain cannot do and I use my brain to do something more sophisticated. The most interesting and powerful part of human brain is that it has creative ideas. And we can use computers to accomplish our ideas and do precise things that our brain might be limited to process. i'm always very curious about the world. I'm not just want that high pay and good work-life balance, although it is a very big count. I have the interest, I have the capacity to do some high level computing and calculating. I have the clear target and goal. Being admitted to MPCS is an entrance for me. It opens the door for me to enter this entirely world, a world that full of everyday things but with principles that's unfamiliar with me. If I want to understand how this world operate, I have to learn CS. After entering this threshold, it will give me more chance to better explore myself. I can even do quant in Fintech company in Chicago. 
I also thank harris that can give me chance to choose different courses (we have 12 elective courses, and can choose 6 courses from other department other than harris. ), so that I can find my interest. I think a face-to-face talk could help me explain my intention more. 


<b>Apr 30 Sat</b><br />
Learned css today. 

<b>May 1 Sun</b><br />
Finished learning css today. 
Suddenly realized that I should also learn my courses well. Because my transcript could come out in June. 

<b>May 2 Mon</b> 101-139/503 <br />
Today finished the accounting midterm. 
Sent email to baihonghuan to ask for recommendation letter. Wrote nearly 2000 words. I am really a good writer. I even got moved by my motivation and journey by reading my own words. Hope he could see my email. 
Reviewed Javascript in the web develop bootcamp. 
Also scheduled an appointment with Shilin on friday. And registered for the info session next Thursday. Hope to meet the admission team. 

<b>May 3 Tue</b> 140-165/503<br /> 
Today i'm learning javascript in my home for the whole day. Did not see a lot of progress. 
I think I might need to publish my own website as soon as possible. So that I could see more progress and gain more confidence.

<b>May 4 Wed</b> /503 <br />
I scheduled an interview tomorrow. It's a start-up making a school website platform for Washington University. I am sooooooo nervous. This is my first time to take a job interview. 





First time to take a job interview. <br /> 
First time to attend professor's office hour.<br /> 
First time to schedule meeting with staff. <br /> 
First time to reach out to people and alumni on LinkedIn. <br /> 
First time to find internship by myself. <br /> 
First time to ask information from others and say tons of thank you. <br /> 
When you have a goal, all of these things become normal and not so difficult. And you'll find yourself not so nervous as before. <br /> 
I did a lot of things that I dare not to do before. <br /> 
I'm growing stronger. <br /> 

May 8 
Feel the importance to maintain the relationship with others. Always be kind and keep an appealing appearance to others, keep connect with others. Help others and then others can help you. 

May 10
Having new thoughts about learning CS. At first I only value its high pay and good work-life balance. After the investment class, I thought computer science is like a window for me to look at a bigger world. Now as the project conducting, I felt that I like the way that engineers working together. We have the same goal (to make a prodect), and every one of us has the freedom to add new features to the product. And every one is so kind to each other that will help newly added members grow. And there are plenty of resources online that you can learn by yourself and improve yourself. I felt like I am always learning. 

May 15 
Improved my resume today. Multitasking ends in low efficiency. Have to get up early tomorrow morning to prepare for the stand-up meeting materials.

今天还是在做网站首页。我觉得对我来说有很多值得思考的东西。
我每次做的时候就想先画个设计稿。画着画着我就觉得 我并不知道这个网站到底要干什么。
我不是说想搞成小红书那样的卡片式布局就叫好，网站页面的设计是为其功能性服务的。
光是网站首页到底要放多少元素的问题就够我想的了。
我一方面主观希望这个网站是能够具有一定时代感的。（小红书、b站基于图片的页面）
另一方面又不得不承认这个网站是以信息共享为主的。（传统论坛，贴吧，基于文字的页面布局）必须展示了这些在首页才能让用户点进去才能用啊。
但是又不能两者都做，会显得功能性更加不清晰。
兼顾的比较好的是知乎平台，reddit也是这种component样式。但是这样一个页面能直接看到的信息就很少，主要是生活分享的功能了。
对于论坛来说，有不同的版块，确实就是需要在首页展示所有的板块，用户发帖至少也能被看到。
列表式的页面可以用在具体的某一个板块里面，这样能展示更多具体的信息。而且这些信息都是一类的，所以不需要考虑多样性问题。
但是在一个网站的电脑页面上能够展示更多的东西。就算之后要做mobile app，网站也是一个展示所有板块的入口。
所以说存在即合理。
我先按照传统板块来做。之后再进行改进。
网页元素多/少，详/略的问题。没有谁对谁错，看功能性吧。
功能和形式之间也要兼顾。
云朵朵的诞生在于其功能性。有了功能之后形式只是一个载体。是内容先于技术
抖音平台是技术大于功能性。其实内容还是那一些，根据“短视频”的技术特性进行创作之后才逐渐有了功能性。是技术先于内容。


内容和形式的关系问题是一门学问。


29 May
I was thinking, why must I transfer to cs major? Only to find a high-paid job? Is high salary really what I need? 
What on earth is my interest? 
It is really hard for me to take the accounting final exam. And I am really not so into investment as I think. 
I talked to Fangze. She asked me what made me feel passionate when doing one thing? I said hanging out and play. She then asked what is inside these things that made me feel passionate. I said it is something that is not the same as my everyday life and the beauty of nature (made by universe, all creatures). She said I can learn biology hahahah. I really loved biology at some time before. More specifically, natural history. I also love art, psychology, philosophy. But they may not be able to give a job that can support me. But fangze said, at least they can give you passion when you are learning. For example, when she studied biology, she can think of biology all day long, even in the dream. When you have this kind of passion, how can you not do it well? But when she studied finance, she did not have this kind of passion, only trying to get a good grade in class. Passion has a lot of power. 
When I am writing these, I suddenly thought that social division of labor has its inherent contradiction. There is always a gap between what people love to do and what they have to do. And it is nature that some people are not doing what they are actually love. And it is not always possible to turning your interest into a job. Even you can do that, this may also make you lose your interest when you have to deal with everyday things with it. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102711675/170891154-64483aa1-f85f-43ea-ac10-e54596b9cf67.png)
I also asked 66, "do you really love math?" He said, "there is no 'love or not', only 'should do or not'. " This is also true to Lina. There are also people that do not have clear interest. So they just choose a major that is easy for them to find a job to get some money. There are also people that no need to worry about finding a job. So they have freedom to choose whatever they like or to their benefit. I know what I love. I know my own limits when doing things I love. I dont have the brave to say no to making a lot of money and buy things I love without thinking about the price. 而且事实是，当lhz用一些奢侈品的时候我就是会心动，就是会羡慕。就是会想拥有。说是资本主义的毒害也罢（客观上），但也是主观上我无法控制自己的欲望。七情六欲没办法断干净。但要真的通过出家冥想等方式断干净了七情六欲，应该做什么事情都没有什么意义而且也能做好了吧。或者说，至少知道自己做一件事情的目的是什么。“三十而立，四十不惑，五十而知天命，六十耳顺，七十而从心所欲，不逾矩。”所以五十才能知道自己真正应该干什么，四十才能解除自己心中的疑惑，但三十就能独立了。所以说立身之本不一定是完成理想，甚至要处理理想和现实之间的差距，这是人之常情吧。对于一些人际关系上的处理，也可能要到了六十才真的不去因为别人说的话做的事计较得失和悲喜。七十才能随心所欲地做事，并且那些社会规范已经内化于心了，是发自内心地推导了一遍，而不是说被迫接受社会习俗，甚至有一些推翻权威的举动，而是从心中认可并遵从这些规定。我现在只是要找一个立身之本罢了。
也不知道是不是年纪上去了之后能接受的东西越来越少了，cs对我的兴趣没有四年前那么深刻了。I said, when the cost of transfering to cs is higher than the benefit it can bring to me, then there is no need for me to transfer. If my objective is finding a job, then do what cant give me this benefit? Learning cs is not necessary for me. 
So what on earth is my reason of transfering to cs? I think it is that I can do more with computer science, or broadly, technology. I can understand some basic structure of this IT world. Especially when our life is highly depend and even build on it. This is the future of the world. If I want to step into the leadership board that lead this world, it is a must for me to learn computer science. Also , with a computer science skills, I can do what I want much easily. For example, I want to develop a mobile app that can play aloud music based on guitar 谱子。Software engineer is not a must for my future job. I will know what I want to do after I learned cs. I will not write some stories that I made up not from my true heart. This is how I think. I admit that I have the disire to affect the world. But I think with a MPP degree it is not enough. I need to approach and dive deep into the tech world. Computer science can be my entrance to this larger world. After I learned cs, it is natural for me to learn robotics (make AI robotics), learn finance (do fintech), stimulate gene (bioinfomatics). CS is a must and basic foundation for me doing all of these things.
