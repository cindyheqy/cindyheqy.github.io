# My Diary

Apr 13: 
Talked with Yunhao. He said I can apply for the summer internship in this fall and recommend to me some data science bootcamp.
Talked with Yu. He suggested me to apply for a CS master degree. But I think that's too expensive and time-consuming. 
Ruixuan suggested me to take a gap year but I'm worried about wasting the time. 
Connected with Dajing. She suggusted me to do some unpaid projects. But I think I need to first acquire some basic skills for coding. And I also need to begin doing Leetcode. Also very important to revise my resume and build my network!!!

Apr 14: 
Though very tired, I came to the Python class. Completed HW2 at noon and had Mc Donald!!! (strawberry shake and $1 large fries..). I asked TAs and the professor for help when I had difficulty understand the question. Also learned what 'argument' is and how to create a 'class'. 
Learned 'variables' and 'objects' in Javascript. 

Apr 15: 
Learned 'operations and methods' in Javascript in the morning. 
Revised my resume and built my LinkedIn profile with Lina~ (Also helped her and Nilaoshi do some python debug) 
Too anxious to fall asleep at night...

Apr 16: 
Purchased a new Macbook Pro on Apple.com. It will be delivered after May 24th. Cannot wait! (\ANGRY)	&#128555;
Failed to complete the coding challenge for 'Hack Reacter' bootcamp, which is actually my goal for last day. But it's OK since it's on weekend. 

Apr 17: 
Failed to fall asleep again last night. 
Saw someone posted an article saying that less than 10% of the Chinese MPP student in Harris found a job in the US. I was kinda disappointed and discouraged. I think I do not have a CS master degree, and I learn all the things not systematically. I also lack some project experience. Even not clear about my career goal. Why am I outstanding among all talented candidates? Passion? Does my passion really matters so much that can make me outstanding? I also need work permit, which makes it even more difficult to find a SDE job and stay in the US. But what can I do? The only thing that I can do is to continue learning, continue searching for projects, continue being anxious. The only way to get through is to not thinking too much and just do it. I CAN DO IT. 

生活磨平了我的棱角
可我还是想做个小孩

Made an appointment for the tech interview of Hack Reactor bootcamp. And completed non-tech assessment for App Academy. 
Considering transfer to a CS master program. Made appointment to talk with MPCS admission specialst on Tuesday and talk with academic advisor on Thursday. 
Also considering other CS master program like NEU. But the title is not so good (tbh). 

Apr 18: 
Had a phone call with Bri and scheduled the A/A non-tech interview on Wednesday afternoon. And will prep with Bri on that same day in the morning. 
Received reply for visa problem. Gina said that during the gap quarte / year, I would be illegal to say in the US. I realized the problem that those internship for large company requires me to go back to school after the internship. Or I have to apply for the full-time job. So I have to talk to the Academic Advisor to see if it is ok to change my graduate year to the next year. Also I need to check if I could have time to do CPT after the gap year. Also I have to browse some JD for last year internship.

Sitting in the dt gleacher classrom. <br> 
Taking accounting as background music. <br> 
Looking around:   <br> 
All elites with booth name tag. <br> 
Browsing 1acre3points. <br> 
Thinking: Do I really love these things? <br> 
Suddenly feel like I am a loser. <br> 
Too many thoughts, too few actions. <br> 
High intellegence, low social skills. <br> 
Always hesitate, afraid to take risk. <br> 

The bad thing: I know this is not I want now. <br> 
The good thing is: At least I know what I want and a way to pursue. <br>

有那么多人努力了还是很难<br> 
我也轻而易举得到过很多别人没有机会拥有的东西<br> 
安慰自己每一个选择都是当下最好的选择吧<br>

Today I did the tech interview for Hack Reactor bootcamp. First time do live coding and talk aloud my way of thinking. I am quite sure that I can get admitted since I'm prepared and did several coding problems successfully. Though my mind went blank at first and I requested for help, I did the rest of the problems successfully. So the fact tells us I should request help once get stuck. Also I have to train myself to say aloud my thinking while coding. This is also something important in the future interview. <br>
I posted my way of changing my career goal to SDE on 1point3acres. Suprisingly my undergraduate classmates contacted me and recommend his bro to me. He shared some information about cs program to me. Also a lot of friends contacted me through linkedIn. Hope to get more connection with them! 
I believe I can do this. I think all the effort I have done has already persuaded myself that I am really very decided to persist on this way. And I belive that 'Nothing is impossible to a willing heart.' Also, although seeing that technical stock decreases a lot, this is still the best and almost the only way to saty in the US.

CANNOT fall asleep again! Emailed academic advisor for the meeting at noon.
