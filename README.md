# My Diary

Apr 13: 
Talked with Yunhao. He said I can apply for the summer internship in this fall and recommend to me some data science bootcamp.
Talked with Yu Wang. He suggested me to apply for a CS master degree. But I think that's too expensive and time-consuming. 
Ruixuan suggested me to take a gap year but I'm worried about wasting the time. 
Connected with Dajing. She suggusted me to do some unpaid projects. But I think I need to first acquire some basic skills for coding. And I also need to begin doing Leetcode. Also very important to revise my resume and build my network!!!

Though very tired, I came to the Python class. Completed HW2 at noon and had Mc Donald!!! (strawberry shake and $1 large fries..). I asked TAs and the professor for help when I have difficulty understand the question. Also learned what 'argument' is and how to create a 'class'. 
Learned 'variables' and 'objects' in Javascript. 

Apr 15: 
Learned 'operations and methods' in Javascript in the morning. 
Revised my resume and build my LinkedIn profile with Lina~ (Also help her and Nilaoshi some python debug) 
Too anxious to fall asleep at night...

Apr 16: 
Purchased a new Macbook Pro on Apple.com. It says it will be delivered after May 24th. Cannot wait! (\ANGRY)
