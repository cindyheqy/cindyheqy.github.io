# My Diary

Apr 13: 
Talked with Yunhao. He said I can apply for the summer internship in this fall and recommend to me some data science bootcamp.
Talked with Yu. He suggested me to apply for a CS master degree. But I think that's too expensive and time-consuming. 
Ruixuan suggested me to take a gap year but I'm worried about wasting the time. 
Connected with Dajing. She suggusted me to do some unpaid projects. But I think I need to first acquire some basic skills for coding. And I also need to begin doing Leetcode. Also very important to revise my resume and build my network!!!

Apr 14: 
Though very tired, I came to the Python class. Completed HW2 at noon and had Mc Donald!!! (strawberry shake and $1 large fries..). I asked TAs and the professor for help when I had difficulty understand the question. Also learned what 'argument' is and how to create a 'class'. 
Learned 'variables' and 'objects' in Javascript. 

Apr 15: 
Learned 'operations and methods' in Javascript in the morning. 
Revised my resume and built my LinkedIn profile with Lina~ (Also helped her and Nilaoshi do some python debug) 
Too anxious to fall asleep at night...

Apr 16: 
Purchased a new Macbook Pro on Apple.com. It will be delivered after May 24th. Cannot wait! (\ANGRY)	&#128555;
Failed to complete the coding challenge for 'Hack Reacter' bootcamp, which is actually my goal for last day. But it's OK since it's on weekend. 

Apr 17: 
Failed to fall asleep again last night. 
Saw someone posted an article saying that less than 10% of the Chinese MPP student in Harris found a job in the US. I was kinda disappointed and discouraged. I think I do not have a CS master degree, and I learn all the things not systematically. I also lack some project experience. Even not clear about my career goal. Why am I outstanding among all talented candidates? Passion? Does my passion really matters so much that can make me outstanding? I also need work permit, which makes it even more difficult to find a SDE job and stay in the US. But what can I do? The only thing that I can do is to continue learning, continue searching for projects, continue being anxious. The only way to get through is to not thinking too much and just do it. I CAN DO IT. 

生活磨平了我的棱角
可我还是想做个小孩

Made an appointment for the tech interview of Hack Reactor bootcamp. And completed non-tech assessment for App Academy. 
Considering transfer to a CS master program. Made appointment to talk with MPCS admission specialst on Tuesday and talk with academic advisor on Thursday. 
Also considering other CS master program like NEU. But the title is not so good (tbh). 

Apr 18: 
Had a phone call with Bri and scheduled the A/A non-tech interview on Wednesday afternoon. And will prep with Bri on that same day in the morning. 
Received reply for visa problem. Gina said that during the gap quarte / year, I would be illegal to say in the US. I realized the problem that those internship for large company requires me to go back to school after the internship. Or I have to apply for the full-time job. So I have to talk to the Academic Advisor to see if it is ok to change my graduate year to the next year. Also I need to check if I could have time to do CPT after the gap year. Also I have to browse some JD for last year internship.

Sitting in the dt gleacher classrom. <br> 
Taking accounting as background music. <br> 
Looking around:   <br> 
All elites with booth name tag. <br> 
Browsing 1acre3points. <br> 
Thinking: Do I really love these things? <br> 
Suddenly feel like I am a loser. <br> 
Too many thoughts, too few actions. <br> 
High intellegence, low social skills. <br> 
Always hesitate, afraid to take risk. <br> 

The bad thing: I know this is not I want now. <br> 
The good thing is: At least I know what I want and a way to pursue. <br>

Today I did the tech interview for Hack Reactor bootcamp. First time do live coding and talk aloud my way of thinking. I am quite sure that I can get admitted since I'm prepared and did several coding problems successfully. Though my mind went blank at first and I requested for help, I did the rest of the problems successfully. So the fact tells us I should request help once get stuck. Also I have to train myself to say aloud my thinking while coding. This is also something important in the future interview. <br>
I posted my way of changing my career goal to SDE on 1point3acres. Suprisingly my undergraduate classmates contacted me and recommend his bro to me. He shared some information about cs program to me. Also a lot of friends contacted me through linkedIn. Hope to get more connection with them! 
I believe I can do this. I think all the effort I have done has already persuaded myself that I am really very decided to persist on this way. And I belive that 'Nothing is impossible to a willing heart.' Also, although seeing that technical stock decreases a lot, this is still the best and almost the only way to saty in the US. 

<b>Apr 21 Thu</b><br />
CANNOT fall asleep again! Talked with my academic advisor at noon face to face in his office, and he said that I can withdraw from the MPP program before next fall and return back any time later (but have to apply again). He also recommended me to talk with OIA to confirm the visa problem. He also recommended me a MSCAPP staff that I can contact with. <br>
Asked Yu and he referred Yunchen to me, who is a MPCS student with an undergraduate major in Chinese Literature. She emphasized the importance of a SDE internshiip. 
Received a lot of connections on LinkedIn. Really appreciate everyone's kindness to me. They allocate their limited time to help me, which moves me and encourages me a lot. Also got few people to refer to when meeting difficulties. <br>

<u><b>THANKS EVERYONE WHO OFFERED HELP TO ME!</b></u>

<b>Apr 22 Fri</b><br />
I think I spend too much time on chatting with others these days. But this might be a necessary process. I did get a lot of information and help. Just a little bit disappointed when others did not reply to me. <br>
Received offer from Hack Reactor Bootcamp. <br>
Began application process for MPCS master program. Deciding who to ask for recommendation letter. 

<b>Apr 23 Sat</b><br />
Started learning 'The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022' on Udemy. Laying on the bed for the most of the day. Searched how to write personal statement when applying to a new major. Emailed a youtuber who learned international Relation in her first master degree. Hope to connect with her and ask her about her motivation to transfer to cs master degree. 

<b>Apr 24 Sun</b><br />
I started to know more about the software engineer position itself. Watched lots of videos on Youtube made by software engineers (<u>HackBear</u>). Also trying to find more people in this field to connect with. Hope to know more in this field. <br />

<b>Apr 25 Mon</b><br />
I called Ely DING. He learned my background and suggested me to: 1. take the placement exam and get a good grade. 2. connect with people in cs department face to face. 3. do some projects with hard cs tools. He also gave me a lot of advice on application details. 
Also asked Adagio about her writing of personal statement. She suggested me to think more about the vision of computer science. 

<b>Apr 26 Tue</b><br />
Did two big things today. 
1. Went to the office hour of Professor Jeff Levy. Talked with him my plan of becoming a software engineer. He suggested me to pursue a CS master degree (compared to attending a bootcamp or learning by myself). Because a CS degree shows as a signal that you are very dedicated to this field, both time and money. He also suggested me to learn C and do some projects using html.  <br>
2. Went to the CS department. I REALLY LOVE BEING THERE! They all look rigorous and energetic. I love their labs. I love those tech-looking people. Wish I could be an undergraduate student majoring in computer science. I saw their notes on the whiteboard. They are really loving those codes and doing things they love. They are so energetic and full of thoughts. It gives me a feeling that those talents are discussing something that can change the world (sounds crazy). And I also really love the building, the inner design of the JCL. Mordern and fashion. Lots of discussion and learning space outside the conference room and labs. It's easy to get lost in the building though hahahah! Also met Emma! She's so kind and suggested me to email the questions@cs.uchicago.edu. Thanks her!

Had a lot of thoughts today. When I'm in the investment class, I suddenly found myself loving doing regression and those complicated calculating stuff. I kinda think myself as weird, because in previous times I never believe anyone really loves those math things. If there is someone loving theses things, then they must be weird. But finally when I found myself interested in it, I suddenly can understand this kind of feeling and think everyone is unique and has his or her own love. This also strengthens my belief to do CS. I actually have a deeper thought after today's class. 
i see computer as an extension of my brain. I can use computer to do some stuff that my brain cannot do and I use my brain to do something more sophisticated. The most interesting and powerful part of human brain is that it has creative ideas. And we can use computers to accomplish our ideas and do precise things that our brain might be limited to process. i'm always very curious about the world. I'm not just want that high pay and good work-life balance, although it is a very big count. I have the interest, I have the capacity to do some high level computing and calculating. I have the clear target and goal. Being admitted to MPCS is an entrance for me. It opens the door for me to enter this entirely world, a world that full of everyday things but with principles that's unfamiliar with me. If I want to understand how this world operate, I have to learn CS. After entering this threshold, it will give me more chance to better explore myself. I can even do quant in Fintech company in Chicago. 
I also thank harris that can give me chance to choose different courses (we have 12 elective courses, and can choose 6 courses from other department other than harris. ), so that I can find my interest. I think a face-to-face talk could help me explain my intention more. 


<b>Apr 30 Sat</b><br />
Learned css today. 

<b>May 1 Sun</b><br />
Finished learning css today. 
Suddenly realized that I should also learn my courses well. Because my transcript could come out in June. 

<b>May 2 Mon</b> 101-139/503 <br />
Today finished the accounting midterm. 
Sent email to baihonghuan to ask for recommendation letter. Wrote nearly 2000 words. I am really a good writer. I even got moved by my motivation and journey by reading my own words. Hope he could see my email. 
Reviewed Javascript in the web develop bootcamp. 
Also scheduled an appointment with Shilin on friday. And registered for the info session next Thursday. Hope to meet the admission team. 

<b>May 3 Tue</b> 140-165/503<br /> 
Today i'm learning javascript in my home for the whole day. Did not see a lot of progress. 
I think I might need to publish my own website as soon as possible. So that I could see more progress and gain more confidence.

<b>May 4 Wed</b> /503 <br />
I scheduled an interview tomorrow. It's a start-up making a school website platform for Washington University. I am sooooooo nervous. This is my first time to take a job interview. 





First time to take a job interview. <br /> 
First time to attend professor's office hour.<br /> 
First time to schedule meeting with staff. <br /> 
First time to reach out to people and alumni on LinkedIn. <br /> 
First time to find internship by myself. <br /> 
First time to ask information from others and say tons of thank you. <br /> 
When you have a goal, all of these things become normal and not so difficult. And you'll find yourself not so nervous as before. <br /> 
I did a lot of things that I dare not to do before. <br /> 
I'm growing stronger. <br /> 

May 8 
Feel the importance to maintain the relationship with others. Always be kind and keep an appealing appearance to others, keep connect with others. Help others and then others can help you. 

May 10
Having new thoughts about learning CS. At first I only value its high pay and good work-life balance. After the investment class, I thought computer science is like a window for me to look at a bigger world. Now as the project conducting, I felt that I like the way that engineers working together. We have the same goal (to make a prodect), and every one of us has the freedom to add new features to the product. And every one is so kind to each other that will help newly added members grow. And there are plenty of resources online that you can learn by yourself and improve yourself. I felt like I am always learning.
